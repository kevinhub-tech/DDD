### Project Detail
This module provides the students some exploration upon how the data works in a system nowadays to sustain the application. It was administered to learn about the data process and request the students to create their own database in a functionable manner and develop a technical documentation about it. The scenario was to 

- Develop a database system for a community portal
- Implement the necessary database function by using queries for the portal
- Evaluate on how the database function will integrate with the portal

This project had given me a chance to have a contact on the database operation and enhance on my logical thinking upon different aspects of a software.

### Languages and Tools Applied
- MySQL
- PhpMyAdmin
- Microsoft Visio
- Dbdesc
- Mockaroo
- ERD Plus

### What I have done

There is not much to showcase in this criteria as the module was about understanding the database process and the outcomes are just rather reports and documentation. Nonetheless, I will still display what I have invested my efforts into the project. 

- Implemented a database design patterns
- Developed a database based on those design patterns
- Normalized Database system to its final version to inter-relate the tables
- Integrated tables inside the database to perform functions
- Acquired knowledge of database queries to create a operation upon datas
- Elaborated on how database solutions are integrated with the system
- Created a technical documents upon the current database system

### Accomplishments

The accomplishments were the improvement upon my comprehension about the database queries and how to apply them significantly to create a solution for the system. It allowed me to understand how it can also accelarate the power of performance in a system if the database is handled in a sophisticated and updated manner. At the end of the day, the database system was developed, including the functions such as "Registration, Login, Editing the Profile, Deleting a user" and etc.
